      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>An energetic, active, and “are willing to do” student pursuing a first-year Bachelor of Commerce at Curtin
        University with enthusiasm for technology and network marketing, searching to work in an increasingly dynamic
        technology industry.
        <br><br>
        As a passionate and detail-oriented industry professional, I enjoy approaching people with passion and dreams. A
        large part of my success while working with people stems from my ability to understand their needs, coaching, and
        training more future leaders in the industry. Have a look at the work I’ve done in the past, and get in touch to learn
        more.
