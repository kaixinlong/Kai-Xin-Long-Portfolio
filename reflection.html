      <h2>This is reflection section on learning</h2>
      <p>As a beginner in this field, designing a portfolio webpage from scratch is something I had never thought
         but I am very happy because this project gave me the opportunity to experience learning an unknown field.
         I was very overwhelmed at the beginning and had no idea where to start, 
         so I started to re-watch the ilecture recording for revision and then looked for information online.</p>
        
      <br>
    
      <p>I was intrigued that although my initial code and test runs failed, 
        the challenge of troubleshooting the problem motivated me to keep trying. 
        It was a time-consuming process, but I felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction once the issue was resolved. 
        Despite this, I feel that this page falls short of my vision, 
        as I am still limited in my ability to take it to the next level. 
        However, with more practice, I hope to be able to bridge the gap between my ideas and the reality of my web pages.</p>
